Increase Supply Limit , -1RP (24/08/2023, 9:56:08 pm)",,,,"Initially believed to be a splinter fleet of Leviathan directly, some speculate that Hive Fleet Bakunawa originally were a small part of another splinter fleet at first - Hive Fleet Kronos. The extremely potent psychic abilities of Bakunawa seem to support that theory with increasing vigor, as reports indicate high numbers of Zoanthropes being deployed against defending worlds.
The main difference between the two however, is Bakunawa's use of Lictors. All reports of Bakunawa encounters state that the number of Lictors encountered before and during the initial invasion is higher than average for the splinter fleets size. 
Seeming to favor this dual nature of psychic potency and stealthy terror tactics, Bakunawa has proven itself to be an increasing threat to all that cross it's path.

Renowned Heroes (Magos Sepurnichus), -1RP (24/08/2023, 9:54:35)",64J7zY8vS9SDzCK8Ehjk.Q,,,"The forges of Mars burned bright as always, creating a kaleidoscope of dancing shadows on the wall behind Magos Sepernichus as he stared out of the only external view port of his chambers, not really paying attention to the images processed initially by organic eyes, then filtered and rendered through several systems in order to extract every last detail from the sight. 

What he was looking at was scarcely important compared to the alert he’d just received from his noosphere link. Having already absorbed all available data on the blasphemous blight they called the Tyranid, it had been many revolutions since any new data had been brought to his attention.

This was different to the rest too. This wasn’t the vain pondering of yet another self assured Magos, speculating on the species as though their opinion was relevant in a vast sea of them.
This was a military alert. He wouldn’t have even seen this if he’d stayed within the arbitrary boundaries his “betters” set on his research.

No matter though. This was the chance for new data. 
The fires continued to burn as the Magos formulated a plan to get himself and his retinue to the source of this alert.

“Servitor!” The Magos summoned one of the thousands of lobotomized slaves to his side.
“Yes Magos?” came an inhuman wheeze in return. 

“Summon the Alphas immediately. I will require the services of their Kill Clades for the indefinite future. They belong to me now.”

“They will accompany me to Kaledor.”
